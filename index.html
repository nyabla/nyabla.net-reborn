            <p>
                hello! i am an undergraduate robotics student and a bit of a dweeb nerd
            </p>
            <p>
                i am interested in a lot of different things, here's a
                (non-exhaustive, alphabetised) list for your enjoyment
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>art and craft</i> - i dabble in watercolours and drawing and pastels and
                    whittling and crocheting. fun ways to spend time
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>design</i> - i really like graphic design. i especially love print design.
                    the satisfaction of creating something and then seeing it in print is 
                    priceless. i also like typography and try to think of my own fonts! (only 
                    on paper though)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>drugs</i> - im interested in the legislation around drugs
                    and the human drive to alter your own consciousness
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>electronics</i> - duh im a robotics student. i like making circuits! it's very fun
                    to design something for a purpose and then it does the thing!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>mathematics</i> - i think proofs are pretty and satisfying. the abstract is
                    a lovely place to reside
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>music</i> - i play piano and pipe organ and "play" the recorder, ukulele, melodica,
                    <a href="https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/winds/casual_wind_instruments/venova/index.html">venova</a>, oboe,
                    you get the idea. I like jazz, rock, romantic (as in the period), ambient,
                    medieval (and historical in general), and experimental stuff. I'm wanting to
                    make myself a pair of <a href="https://youtu.be/eWwtNO168kI">auli</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>mycology</i> - i think mushrooms are very cool and i like hunting for,
                    and then eating them!
                    this is an extension of my love for being able to identify living things
                    and the fact that there is so much to discover about them
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>mythology</i> - i love learning about ancient cultures, religions, and folklore
                    by exploring myths
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>programming</i> - i like trying out new languages and making little trinkets.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                this site is purposefully completely handwritten html and css! i think that
                using frameworks or generators or stuff distracted me a bit. im happy to return
                to this lofi and clunky method. it has its quirks and its cute. i will be adding
                to it whenever i feel like it. hopefully i dont get fed up with it very quickly 
                as i have with many of its predecessors.
            </p>
