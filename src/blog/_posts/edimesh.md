summary: my latest project. will it happen?
---

I've decided that I want to go ahead with this project... it's not small and it's
not easy, but it *is* very exciting.

inspired by [guifi](https://guifi.net/en) and [nyc mesh](https://nycmesh.net/) comes
[edinburgh mesh](https://edimesh.net/)! right now it is non-existent. if you are
in edinburgh and are interested in helping, please get in touch! i will need help
with:

- project management
- infrastructure planning
- networking
- regulatory requirements
- incorporation
- sourcing hardware
- sourcing bandwidth
- acquiring funding
- communications (pr)

and honestly any other skills you might have to offer...

if you like the sound of it, there's a dedicated contact email on the (temporary)
website, at [https://edimesh.net/](https://edimesh.net/)
